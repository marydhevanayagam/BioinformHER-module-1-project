# **Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene**

## 1. **Project Overview**

To apply bioinformatics skills to analyze and interpret the sequence of the human TNF gene, which encodes a proinflammatory cytokine called TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor). This project involves downloading the sequence, translating it, finding ORFs, analyzing sequence composition, identifying transcription factor binding sites, searching for functional motifs, predicting coding/non-coding regions, and converting sequence file formats.
